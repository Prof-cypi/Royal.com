    <h1><i><u>introduction to ethnical hacking</u></i></h1>
   <p>Ethical hacking is the practice of testing a computer system, a network or an application to find security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by criminal hackers. Ethical hackers use the same tools and techniques as criminal hackers, but they do so with permission from the owner of the system being tested.</p>
    <p><h2>Type of hackers </h2></p>
    Here are the three hacking hat types explained:

<h3>Black hat hackers</h3>

Black hat hackers are cybercriminals that illegally crack systems with malicious intent. Seeking to gain unauthorized access to computer systems is the definition of black hat hacking. Once a black hat hacker finds a security vulnerability, they try to exploit it, often by implanting a virus or other type of malware such as a trojan.

Ransomware attacks are another favored ploy that black hat hackers use to extort financial gains or breach data systems.

Black hat hackers are also referred to as malicious hackers, unethical hackers, and crackers.

<h3>White hat hackers</h3>

White hat hackers, also known as ethical security hackers, identify and fix vulnerabilities. Hacking into systems with the permission of the organizations they hack into, white hat hackers try to uncover system weaknesses in order to fix them and help strengthen overall internet security.

Many cybersecurity leaders started out as white hat hackers, but the vital role played by ethical hacking is still widely misunderstood, as made clear by a recent ethical hacking case in Germany.

White hat hackers working on a team can be referred to as sneakers, hacker clubs, red teams, or tiger teams.

<h3>Gray hat hackers</h3>

Gray hat hackers may not have the criminal or malicious intent of a black hat hacker, but they also don’t have the prior knowledge or consent of those whose systems they hack into. Nevertheless, when gray hat hackers uncover weaknesses such as zero-day vulnerabilities, they report them rather than fully exploiting them. But gray hat hackers may demand payment in exchange for providing full details of what they uncovered.

<h3>What’s the difference between white, black, and gray hat hackers?</h3>

<i>The main difference between white, black, and gray hat hackers</i> is the motivation or intent that each type of hacker has when they break into computer systems. White hat hackers probe cybersecurity weaknesses to help organizations develop stronger security; black hat hackers are motivated by malicious intent; and Gray hat hackers operate in the nebulous area in between — they’re not malicious, but they’re not always ethical either.

<i>White, black, and gray hat hackers have different motivations when breaking into systems.</i>
